NBA Feeds Project Summary
Team Members: Obi Asinugo, Emmanuel Chimezie, Eddie Tsai

NBA Feeds is a desktop java application that displays statistical information

modules. He laid out the overall structure for the platform.  He implemented
a system to dynamically generate background and icon images to match the userâ€™s
team preference.
